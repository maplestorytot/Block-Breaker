# Block-Breaker
## Inspiration
A challenging game for those with quick reflex

## What it does
You control a bounce pad that bounces the ball to destroy blocks

## How We Built it
Using C# and Unity2D as well as using some free online resources, texture packs. 

## Challenges We ran into
It was difficult to ensure the paddle's shape was the most optimal shape for gameplay. 

## What we learned
The main concepts I learnt in this project:
  - Adding RigidBody Physics components
  - Collision detection
  - Moving objects with a mouse
  - Adding Gravity
  - Sound effects and particles systems
